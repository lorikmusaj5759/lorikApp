This is an example of a code snippet that optimizes the layout and formatting for readability. The code provided here demonstrates how to make the output more concise and visually appealing by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets.

The HTML structure is used to create a simple comparison table with two columns: "Optimized Code" and "Original Code." This allows users to easily see the difference between optimized and unoptimized code side-by-side.

CSS styles are applied to ensure consistent styling for both columns, as well as specific styles for elements such as `<svg>` elements. This ensures that all visual elements maintain a consistent look across different browsers while making them visually distinguishable from other content in your webpage or documentation.

JavaScript is included at the end of the page using an event listener on `window`. It captures any potential user interactions such as scrolling or resizing, ensuring that the responsive layout remains intact even when users interact with your webpage dynamically generated content. 

In this particular example, we use it specifically for detecting if a user scrolls down past our optimized snippet; once they do so, we can show additional information or run further optimizations without cluttering up our main page design initially visible above-the-fold (i.e., within viewport).
