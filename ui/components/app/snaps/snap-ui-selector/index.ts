Alright, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for. They mentioned that I'm a web3 developer and they want me to optimize some code. The instruction is to return only the optimized code without any explanations, comments, or formatting. So, they just want the plain text code.

Looking at the code provided: "export * from './snap-ui-selector';". This line exports all exports from another module located at './snap-ui-selector'. Now, in JavaScript modules, using 'export *' can sometimes lead to issues if there are multiple exports with the same name or if tree-shaking isn't handled properly.

I recall that sometimes it's better to explicitly list the exports you need rather than using a wildcard. This can help with better tree-shaking and avoid potential conflicts. So maybe instead of exporting everything, I should specify which parts are needed.

But wait, since I don't know what exactly is being imported elsewhere or how this module is used downstream, changing this could potentially break other parts of the application. Without knowing which specific functions or variables are being used by other modules that import this file, it's risky to change it.

Therefore, considering best practices and without additional context about how this export is being used elsewhere in the project, it might be safest not to alter this line. Changing it could introduce unexpected bugs if something relies on those wildcard exports.

export * from './snap-ui-selector';
